Splats (Computer Graphics 2 Project)
---
Splats is a Ping Pong game made in Unity with an emphasis on spreading color throughout
playing the game.

i) Due to me wanting to complete a mostly solid game and not a lot of time, I ended up
not being able to implement some of the more graphically challenging items. However I
still ended up with a decently functioning Ping Pong game with a rally bot to face off
against you and is semi competent in returning your hits. A lot of my work in this game
went towards making sure that the ball physics were a close enough representation and
that hitting the ball felt good. Also a decent amount of time went into making the splats
look how I wanted them to and react properly to the ball.

ii) I feel like the game I made came out a lot closer to how I envisioned then I thought it
would. The splats themselves weren't too hard to figure out, but getting everything
working together and creating a smooth flow for a game of Ping Pong was harder than I
thought and ended up working a lot on this project for the span of a week. I will say that
the controls ended up being badly buggy at times.

Controls
---
The controls in this game can be really buggy, so I thought it was a good idea to include this.

Forehand Swing: Hold down left click to prep the swing, then while holding down left click, right
click and left go of both clicks. Issues arise when you start double clicking on things and double clicking
should be avoided.

Backhand Swing: The same control scheme as forehand, but hold right click and hit left click to
swing instead.

You can also curve the ball to the left and right by holding a or d on the keyboard before the hit.
